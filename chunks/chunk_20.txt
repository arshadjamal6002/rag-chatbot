9. International Buying and Selling; Translation Given the nature of eBay's global marketplace, listings may be viewed and purchased by, and shipped to, buyers around the world. Many of our Services are accessible internationally. We offer certain programs, tools, and experiences of particular interest to international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and international shipping calculation tools. If, as a seller, you do not want your item to be sold to buyers internationally, you can exclude countries or regions you don't want to ship to by adjusting your shipping settings as provided in the International selling policy. Sellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international sale, purchase, and shipment of items. If you purchase an item on an eBay site that is different from your registration site, you are subject to the User Agreement and applicable policies of that other eBay site with respect to that particular purchase, as detailed in the International selling policy. For sellers, you agree that we may display your listing for sale on an eBay site other than the site where you listed your item for sale, based on your shipping settings.
