Therefore, the appearance or placement of listings in search and browse results will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: • buyer's location, search query, browsing site, and history; • item's location, listing format, price and shipping cost, terms of service, end time, history, and relevance to the user query; • seller's history, including listing practices, Detailed Seller Ratings, eBay policy compliance, feedback, and defect rate; and • number of listings matching the buyer's query. • To drive a positive user experience, a listing may not appear in some search and browse results regardless of the sort order chosen by the buyer; • Some advanced listing upgrades will only be visible on some of our Services; • eBay's Duplicate listings policy may also affect whether your listing appears in search results; • Metatags and URL links that are included in a listing may be removed or altered; • We may provide you with optional information to consider when creating your listings.
