Subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the partyâ€™s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.B.7 ("Batch Arbitration"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement to Arbitrate, if a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, determines that the limitations of this Section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and eBay agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court (pursuant to Section 19.C below), subject to your and eBay's right to appeal the court's decision. All other Disputes, aside from those explicitly exempted in Sections 19.B (above), shall be arbitrated. This section does not prevent you or eBay from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims. 4. Arbitration Procedures Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
