A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a demand for arbitration (the "Demand"). A Demand to eBay should be sent by mail to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. If eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a Demand to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. A Demand form is available on NAM's site at https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2024/09/Revised-Comprehensive-Demand-for- Arb-9.17.24.pdf. The Demand must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e-mail address, and eBay user name of the party seeking arbitration, including a statement whether the party is a U.S. resident; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases for those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good-faith calculation of the amount in controversy; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) a statement certifying that the requesting party will pay any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.
