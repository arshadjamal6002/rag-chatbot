NAM shall administer all batches concurrently, to the extent possible. All parties agree that Demands are of a "substantially similar nature" if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issue(s) and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise NAM, and NAM shall appoint a sole standing Procedural Arbitrator or, should the circumstances so require, an Emergency Arbitrator, according to the NAM Rules, to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (the Procedural Arbitrator or Emergency Arbitrator, the "Administrative Arbitrator"). To expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitratorâ€™s fees shall be paid by eBay.
